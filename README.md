### Work-Day-Scheduler

I was employed to create a work day scheduler for a busy client who wishes to manage their time effectively.

## The Goal

The objective was to create a day planner which was colour coded for improved accessability.

The important aspects were:

    - The current date at the top of the page,
    - Colour coded timeblocks for the work day, seperating past, present and future,
    - User input into the description field,
    - Access to the data should they refresh the page.
